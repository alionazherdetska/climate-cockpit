No Beef & Diary,No Beef & Diary,2,food,4,"If everybody in Switzerland stopped eating beef and diary products, annual emissions would be {impact} megatons lower.

This is because cows are very bad for the climate because:

1) When cows digest grass they emmit methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbondioxide.

2) Cows produce large quantities of manure, which releases methane and nitrous oxide as it decomposes.

3) Cows requires large areas of land. This often leads to deforestation, which not only releases the carbon stored in trees but also reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.

4)  Cows require significant amounts of water and feed, which in order to produce, process and transport contributes substantially to CO2 emissions.

If you stop eating cow products, you can significantly reduce emissions. In fact, eating no cow products has a bigger impact than being a vegetarian (who eats diary products).",https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/state/data/greenhouse-gas-inventory.html,,Currently the number of people in Switzerland who do not eating beef and diary products is not tracke.,,I don't eat beef & diary products,NoCow
